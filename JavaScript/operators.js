// operators they are pre-defined sign and symbole that are designed to perform designated operations on operands

// 1. Arithmetic Operators
// a. Addition

// Types of Operators
// ------------------
// Unary operators: +, - (unary)
// Binary operators: *, /, % (binary), ** (exponentiation)
// Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, <<=, >>=, &=, ^=

// Examples
// var x = 5; // Declaration and Initialization
// console.log(x); // Outputs: 5
// x++; // Increment by one
// console.log(x); // Outputs: 6
// --x; // Decrement by one

// Type Coercion
// ---------------
// JavaScript automatically converts values from one type to another when necessary. This is called "type coercion".
// JavaScript automatically converts values from one type to another when performing arithmetic operations. This is called type coercion.
// JavaScript automatically converts values from one type to another when needed. This process is called coercion.
// JavaScript automatically converts values from one type to another when an operation involves mixed types. This process is called type coercion.
// JavaScript automatically converts values from one type to another when performing arithmetic operations. This is known as type coercion.
// JavaScript automatically converts values from one type to another when performing arithmetic operations. This is called type coercion.

// Type Coercion vs Type Conversion
// ----------------------------
// Type conversion is the process of converting an entity from one data type to another. It does not change the value but changes its representation or usage.
// Type conversion is the process of converting an entity from one data type to another. It can be done using explicit conversions or implicit coercion
